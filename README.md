# Horse Race Outcome Prediction

This project represents my first attempt at applying Data Science techniques to solve a real-world problem, completed over the course of a weekend. With no prior hands-on experience in implementing data science methodologies, I took on the challenge of predicting horse race outcomes using two datasets: one containing race results and another detailing race-specific information. The project was driven by my desire to test my abilities and learn through doing, despite the steep learning curve and time constraints. I relied heavily on online resources to guide me through the process, focusing on data cleaning, feature engineering, and building a predictive model using Python and Jupyter Notebook. My approach involved understanding and preprocessing the data, extracting meaningful features, and training a machine learning model using scikit-learn. While the goal was not perfection, I successfully built a functional prediction model, accompanied by visualizations and insights into the data. This experience taught me practical skills in data science, problem-solving under pressure, and the value of a growth mindset. It has inspired me to explore data science further and refine my abilities in this exciting field.
